    <h1>Introduction to Machine Learning Algorithms</h1>
</header>

<article>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Machine learning is a powerful tool that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. In this article, we will cover some of the most common algorithms used in machine learning, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and XGBoost.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Logistic Regression</h2>
    <p>
        Logistic Regression is a statistical model commonly used for binary classification problems. Despite its name, it is actually a classification algorithm. The model estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Decision Trees</h2>
    <p>
        Decision Trees are a type of algorithm that breaks down a dataset into smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes, which makes it very easy to interpret.
    </p>

    <h2>3. XGBoost</h2>
    <p>
        XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced implementation of gradient boosting that is widely used for its high performance and speed. It works by building a series of decision trees, where each tree tries to correct the errors of the previous ones.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Machine learning algorithms are essential tools for building predictive models and solving a variety of problems. Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and XGBoost are just a few examples of the many algorithms available, each with its own strengths and use cases.
